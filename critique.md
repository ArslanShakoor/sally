# Observation

### What I like

1: Easy to follow design and looks pleasant.
2: Every things is looking straight forward without any complication.
3: details are distributed within relevant section.


### What I will like to Change

1: Heading of Each Section should above the section and where we can fold or unfold it because in most cases user expect Heading above the section and below the details.


2: I would like to add in-place edit button(if user 'driver' is viewing) each section should have edit button and we can place edit button on header or below


3: we can also debate here that we should go for fold/unfold design or not It is more looking like a mobile app design rather the desktop/web design.e.g: if you see Angel list profile or Linkedin, we do not have fold/unfold sections nowadays e.g:
https://angel.co/arslan-shakoor-1


4: we can also talk about color combination like in our app we have different status with different header colors ie: active, returned, archived etc. we have orangecolor for active status driver header.
